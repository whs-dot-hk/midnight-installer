/*! An executable, revertable step of an install

An [`Action`] is the 'atom' of change. Actions are either 'base' actions, which
do one thing to the machine ([`CreateDirectory`](base::CreateDirectory),
[`CreateFile`](base::CreateFile), [`StartSystemdUnit`](base::StartSystemdUnit)), or
'composite' actions, which orchestrate sub-[`Action`]s
([`InstallCardanoNode`](cardano::InstallCardanoNode)).

During the plan phase a [`Planner`](crate::planner::Planner) calls an [`Action`]'s `plan`
function, which may accept any arguments and returns a [`StatefulAction`]. `plan` is also
where an action decides it is already done, marking itself
[`Completed`](ActionState::Completed) or [`Skipped`](ActionState::Skipped) so that a second
run is a no-op — the same property the shell steps got from their `[[ -s $file ]]` guards.

Later [`InstallPlan`](crate::InstallPlan) calls [`try_execute`](StatefulAction::try_execute)
on each [`StatefulAction`], and [`try_revert`](StatefulAction::try_revert) in reverse order
if something fails.

How fine-grained an [`Action`] should be is decided by the unit of reversion: anything that
can fail halfway and needs undoing on its own belongs in its own action.
